Supply Chain: Predicting the Final Delivery Status of Shipments and the Actual Number of Days Spent in Transit
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/saicharankomati/dataco-supply-chain-dataset

For this supervised machine learning project, I would like to see whether decision trees or random forests are better at predicting the delivery status of a shipment using features such as payment type, shipping mode, number of days expected in transit, and whether the shipment is international or not. I would also like to see whether OLS or KNN is the better regression model for predicting the actual number of days the shipment spends in transit using the mean squared error as the metric.
